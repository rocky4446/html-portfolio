    <li><h3>Chronicle (2012)</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> Chronicle takes a grounded approach to superheroes, using a found-footage style to tell the story of three teens who gain telekinetic powers. What makes this film special is its focus on the human side of these powers—showing how absolute power can corrupt absolutely. The character dynamics and raw emotional undertone set it apart from typical superhero fare.</p>

    <li><h3>Push (2009)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Review:</strong>  Combining elements of psychic abilities and covert government operations, Push is an overlooked gem. It follows individuals with various supernatural abilities as they fight to stay ahead of a shadowy organization. The world-building and character arcs elevate it from being just another action film, creating a tense and thrilling narrative.

    <li><h3>The Shadow (1994)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Review:</strong> The Shadow is a superhero film based on the pulp magazine character of the same name. The film follows Lamont Cranston, a wealthy playboy who uses his psychic powers to fight crime as the mysterious vigilante known as The Shadow. The film has a dark and moody atmosphere, with a great performance by Alec Baldwin in the lead role. The special effects are a bit dated, but the film's stylish direction and engaging story make up for it.

    <li><h3>Darkman (1990)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Review:</strong> Directed by Sam Raimi, Darkman blends horror with superhero elements. The story of a scientist horribly disfigured and left for dead, seeking revenge against those who wronged him, it’s a gritty and emotional journey. Liam Neeson delivers a compelling performance as the tortured protagonist, making Darkman a cult favorite.

        <h3>The Specials (2000)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Review:</strong> The Specials is a superhero comedy film that follows a group of B-list superheroes who struggle with their own personal issues while trying to save the world. The film is a hilarious deconstruction of the superhero genre, with a great ensemble cast that includes Rob Lowe, Thomas Haden Church, and Jamie Kennedy. The film is full of witty dialogue and clever satire, making it a must-see for any superhero fan.
